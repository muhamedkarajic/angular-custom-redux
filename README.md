## About
This project setup includes only the most needed things when creating an angular project with the new es-lint and prettier libreries for cleaner code.

## Packages
1. ESLint
2. Prettier

## Commands
1. Starting project by typing `ng serve`
2. Check for errors using ESlint by typing `ng lint`
3. Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
